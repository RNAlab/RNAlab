# Open Science Collaboration

The RNAlab is an Open Science laboratory. We believe free and unfettered exchange of information is the most rapid means of scientific progress. Interested in collaborating? We'd love to help you achieve your research aims and/or the oppertunity to work together in realizing ours. [Reach Out](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca).

Have a quick question? You can also join the [RNAlab Slack](mailto:artem@rRNA.ca?subject=Joining%20the%20Serratus%20slack&body=Hello%20I%20would%20like%20to%20join%20the%20Serratus%20chat.%20Thanks!) by requesting an email invite.

# Online Projects

## Logan: Illuminating Earth's Genetic Diveristy

src="{{ "/images/project/logan.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

*Evolution's diversity is humanities heritage*

Genetic sequences are Nature's solutions produced over trillions of years of massively parallel (life's)evolutionary computation. But for each sequence, we don't know problem Nature was optimizing to solve. Logan is a ultra-massive scale interface for accessing 27 million DNA/RNA sequencing datasets, or 50+ petabases of sequence data. Come explore the epic tapestry of genetic diversity on Earth.

## Serratus: Ultra-deep virus discovery

*Forewarned is Forearmed*

Virus discovery is a fundamental step in stopping the next pandemic. We are re-analyzing _all_ public RNA-seq data to uncover novel RNA viruses to understand the global distribution, and evolutionary origins of RNA viruses and virus-like agents.

## Petadex: Plastic-degrading enzyme discovery

<img align="right" style="width: 35%; height: 35%" 
src="{{ "/images/project/petadex.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">

*Microplastics is our generation's Smoking*

Humanity has produced are 12+ billion tons of plastic. The majority end up waste where they degrade into micro- and nanoplastics which contaminate all Earth's ecosystems. We perform ultra-massive scale evolutionary analyses to identify enzymes with potential plastic-degrading activity, and deploy them high-throughput molecular assays. Our objective is to create the neccesary technology for the terraforming-scale remediation of MNP contamination.

## macpÎ¨ rRNA modification is widely lost in human cancer

<img align="right" style="width: 35%; height: 35%"

Ribosomal RNA is the fulcrum of the central dogma of molecular biology. I discovered a highly cancer-specific single nucleotide variant (which was an RNA hyper-modification) in almost half of colorectal carcinoma patients.
